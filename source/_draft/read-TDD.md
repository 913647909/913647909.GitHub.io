TDD rules:
1. write new code only if you first have a failing automated test.
2. eliminate duplication. 消除重复设计

technical implications:
1. design organically: running code providing feedback between decisions.
2. write your own test.
3. development env must provide rapid response to small change.
4. design must be *highly cohesive, loosely coupled components(高内聚,低耦合)* to make **testing easy**.

programing order:
1. Red-write a little that doesn't work.
2. Green-make the test work quickly.
3. Refactor-eliminate all the duplication created.

- 红:写测试
- 绿:写代码通过测试
- 重构:消除重复设计,优化结构
